# Google AI Agents Intensive - Learning Repository
# Synopsis
This repository documents my learning journey through the **Google AI Agents Intensive** (November 10–14) — a focused 5-day program designed to build a deep understanding of **production-ready AI agents** using modern frameworks, tools, and real-world examples.

## 🎯 Purpose

-This repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive workspace for exploring and documenting my journey through the Google AI Agents Intensive. It aims to function as:

-A structured learning environment for organizing daily exercises, experiments, and code implementations.

-A personal knowledge base capturing key concepts, theoretical insights, and reflective notes from each module.

-A practical portfolio showcasing hands-on projects, prototypes, and the final capstone work developed during the course.

-A long-term reference resource for applying AI agent frameworks, orchestration techniques, and best practices in future research and development.

-Beyond short-term learning, this repository reflects a commitment to building reproducible workflows, sharing open learning, and contributing to the growing field of agentic AI systems.
